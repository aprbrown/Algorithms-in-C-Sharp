# Readme

The purpose of this project is to allow me to explore, understand and implement
some of the famous sorting algorithms in C#. By implementing the algorithms
myself, I aim to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of different
solutions whilst also improving my knowledge of the C# language. Development
follows a test-driven approach and each algorithm will be benchmarked against
one another to check performance.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Insertion Method

- Insertion Sort
- Tree Sort

### Selection Method

- Selection Sort
- Heap Sort (Ascending and Descending)

### Merging Method

- Merge Sort

### Partitioning Method

- Quick Sort

### Exchanging Method

- Bubble Sort (Ascending and Descending)

### Hybrid Methods

---

## Benchmarks

Each algorithm is benchmarked against list of integers of a given length.

The first benchmark runs the algorithm against a randomised set of digits.

The second benchmark is against an already sorted list.

The third is ran with a list in reverse order.

Benchmark results will be available in additional files within the
BenchmarkResults directory once they are performed.
