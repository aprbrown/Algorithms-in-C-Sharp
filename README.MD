# Readme
The purpose of this project is to allow me to explore, understand and implement some of the famous sorting algorithms in C#. By implementing the algorithms myself, I aim to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of different solutions whilst also improving my knowledge of the C# language.

## Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
